## 🔄 Methodology

1. Imported and explored the HR dataset
2. Performed data validation to ensure no missing or duplicate employee records
3. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify attrition patterns
4. Analyzed attrition by department, experience, gender, and exit reasons
5. Built Power BI dashboards to visualize insights clearly

## 📈 Key Findings

* Sales and Support departments show higher attrition rates
* Better salary, preferred job location, and higher studies are the top reasons for employee exits
* Employees with 0–3 years of experience are more likely to leave
* Average employee tenure varies significantly across departments
* Gender-based attrition is balanced, indicating attrition is role-driven rather than gender-specific
